Build a production-grade, AI-powered environmental intelligence dashboard named:

🌍 AQI ZERO

A real-time Delhi Air Pollution Mitigation & Drone Surveillance Platform

The UI design should be modern, dark-themed, VS Code inspired, similar to an AI control dashboard with modular tabs and real-time visualization panels.

The system must be scalable, AI-integrated (not rule-based), and suitable for hackathon shortlisting and demo presentation.

🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE

The drone streams real-time environmental + positional + video data to the dashboard.

The platform must:

Display live sensor data

Generate region-specific heatmaps

Detect pollution hotspots using AI

Track drone location using IMU data

Generate authority alerts

Produce risk scoring

Detect banned BS3/BS4 vehicles using live video AI
